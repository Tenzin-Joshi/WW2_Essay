            const fileContent = 'World War II was one of the most devastating and far-reaching conflicts in human history, lasting from 1939 to 1945 and involving most of the worlds nations. It was a war that spanned across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Pacific, causing an unprecedented level of destruction, suffering, and transformation. The war began on September 1, 1939, when Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. This invasion triggered Britain and France to declare war on Germany, initiating the start of the global conflict. However, the seeds of World War II were sown long before that day. The Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I, had imposed harsh penalties and territorial losses on Germany. Many Germans felt humiliated and economically strangled by the treaty, and this discontent allowed Hitler and the Nazi Party to rise to power by promising to restore German pride, rebuild the economy, and defy the treaty. Hitler, driven by expansionist and racist ideologies, sought to unite all German-speaking peoples and conquer Eastern Europe to gain what he called Lebensraum or living space. He had already annexed Austria and the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia before the full-scale war began. As Germany invaded Poland, the Soviet Union also invaded from the east due to a secret pact with Germany known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The war quickly spread. Germany unleashed a new form of warfare known as blitzkrieg, or lightning war, using fast-moving tanks, aircraft, and infantry to quickly overwhelm enemy forces. Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France soon fell to German forces. By mid-1940, only Britain remained as a significant power resisting the Nazis in Western Europe. The Battle of Britain, fought in the skies, marked a turning point as the Royal Air Force successfully defended the United Kingdom from German aerial attacks. Meanwhile, in the East, Japan, a member of the Axis Powers alongside Germany and Italy, was aggressively expanding its empire across Asia and the Pacific. Japan invaded China in 1937, committing horrific atrocities such as the Nanjing Massacre. Tensions with Western powers escalated, and on December 7, 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This event led the United States to officially enter the war. The entry of the United States marked a significant shift in the balance of power. The Allies, which now included the US, Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and many others, coordinated massive military and economic efforts to fight the Axis Powers. The war became truly global, with battles raging in North Africa, the Pacific Islands, Eastern Europe, and the Atlantic Ocean. In 1942 and 1943, the tide began to turn in favor of the Allies. The Soviet Union, after suffering tremendous losses, repelled the German invasion at the Battle of Stalingrad, which became one of the deadliest battles in history. In North Africa, Allied forces defeated German and Italian troops, allowing them to invade Italy and eventually topple Mussolinis Fascist regime. In the Pacific, American forces began a strategy of island hopping, capturing key islands and moving closer to Japan. By 1944, the Allies were ready to invade Nazi-occupied France. On June 6, 1944, known as D-Day, Allied troops stormed the beaches of Normandy in the largest amphibious invasion ever attempted. The success of this operation opened a western front against Germany. As Allied forces advanced from the west and the Soviets pushed from the east, Germany was squeezed from both sides. In April 1945, Soviet troops entered Berlin. Hitler committed suicide, and Germany surrendered unconditionally on May 7, 1945. Meanwhile, in the Pacific, the fight against Japan continued. Fierce battles took place on islands such as Iwo Jima and Okinawa, with heavy casualties on both sides. To avoid a costly land invasion of Japan, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. These bombings killed hundreds of thousands and caused unimaginable devastation. Japan surrendered shortly after, on August 15, 1945, marking the end of World War II. The war had immense consequences. An estimated 70 to 85 million people died, including soldiers and civilians. The Holocaust, the systematic genocide of six million Jews by the Nazis, revealed the depths of human cruelty and led to widespread horror and international condemnation. Cities were destroyed, economies ruined, and millions of people displaced. World War II led to the formation of the United Nations, an international body created to prevent future global conflicts. The United States and the Soviet Union emerged as superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War. Europe was divided, with Eastern Europe under Soviet influence and Western Europe rebuilding with help from the US through the Marshall Plan. Decolonization movements gained momentum, as former colonies in Asia and Africa sought independence after seeing European powers weakened. World War II also spurred technological advances, from radar to jet engines to nuclear weapons. It redefined warfare, diplomacy, and global cooperation. The war showed both the darkest and most heroic aspects of humanity, and its legacy continues to shape our world. The lessons learned from the conflict underscore the importance of diplomacy, tolerance, and the need to stand against tyranny and hatred in all forms. World War II remains a powerful reminder of the cost of aggression and the resilience of those who fight for freedom and justice.';
